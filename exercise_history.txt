A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Your task is to create a Swift function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
You are tasked with writing a function that groups a list of strings into anagrams. An anagram is a word or phrase that is formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as "listen" and "silent". Your function should take an array of strings as input and return a dictionary where the keys are sorted character sequences, and the values are arrays of strings that are anagrams of each other.
